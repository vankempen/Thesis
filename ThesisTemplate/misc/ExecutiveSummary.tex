\begin{abstract}
In this master's thesis I want to research the best option valuation strategy for \emph{airfare lock-in}~products offered by external companies. These type of products enable customers to fixate the price of a flight for a premium, and gives them the possibility to actually buy the ticket at a later time for this specified price. Three different option pricing techniques are being considered: price setting based on a \emph{fixed price}, the \emph{Black-Scholes-Merton model} and a \emph{prediction system}. To determine the best valuation strategy, a simulation model is run. Further sensitivity analysis is done by differing values of the following parameters: \emph{utility of customer} (risk averse - risk loving), \emph{information level of customer} (no information - perfect information) and \emph{strike date} (2~days - 2~weeks).
