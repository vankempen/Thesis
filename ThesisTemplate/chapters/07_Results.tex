\chapter{Results}
This chapter of my Master's Thesis will run and evaluate several simulations. Each simulation has a different set of characteristics defined for every entity. The first will evaluate the case in which the seller has foreknowledge. This unrealistic scenario will be useful as a benchmark to compare other models with, and will be used to show the impact of other variables on the performance of selling airfare~lock-in products.

\todo{next sentence?}
Due to the large amount of routes, only interesting or surprising results will be displayed and analysed in this chapter. Full tables with results can be found in the appendices \todo{ref}.


\section(Benchmark model)
Like stated before, the first model that will be evaluated is the benchmark model. In this simulation model, the seller has perfect information on both flight statistics and customer characteristics. This allows this configuration to be used to compare the performance of the different models, and makes it possible to reduce the impact of the other parameters in the simulation.

\subsection{Characteristics definition}
The benchmark model can be defined using the following characteristics:

\paragraph{Seller has perfect foresight}
This model will simulate a seller that has perfect information on the price movement of all underlying tickets. The company thus knows exactly whether prices will drop op rise in till the end of the maturity date. He thus is able to make predictions on future airfares with a $100\,\%$ accuracy.

\paragraph{Seller knows exact level of $P^F$ of customer}
The company also has complete information on each individual customer's likelihood of travelling ($P^f$). This allows the seller to make precise estimates of the expected payout of the passengers. This will thus enable the option writer to set the option prices accordingly.

For example, when a customer has a $P^f$ of $0.70$, and the seller knows the prices will increase with $\mbox{US\,\$} 10$, he can set the option price to a minimum of $\mbox{US\,\$} 7.0$ ($= 0.70 \times 10$). This is because the company knows that \emph{on average}, it only has to pay out $\mbox{US\,\$} 10$ in $70\,\%$ of the cases. This is the minimum willingness to accept of the seller.

The seller computes the option price he offers to the customer by multiplying the previously described percentage of expected payout by a specific margin. To ensure no options for under zero US\$ will be sold, the seller sets his minimum willingness to accept to 1 (as WTA is defined relative to the current ticket price $F_0$).

$$ V_s = (1 + \min(\mbox{WTA}, 1) \times r) $$

In the current configuration with the seller with perfect information, the margin can be seen as the part of the equation that will yield profits for the seller. The cases further in this chapter --- in which the seller does not know the exact level of price movements --- the margin will also serve as a technique to reduce losses resulted by underestimation of future fare changes due to forecasting errors.

The best level of margin that will result in the optimization of total profits yielded by this simulation will be evaluated in later this section.


\paragraph{Customer uses strong-form rational expectation}
To make his own predictions, the customer uses the strong-form rational expectation method. This technique assumes that \emph{on average} the passengers predict the exact observed future price. However, to every forecast is associated a random error. This error term follows a certain distribution $\epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(1, \sigma^2)$. The predictions of a customer thus follow the following equation:

$$ E[F_m] = F_m \times \epsilon $$

In which $E[F_m]$ is the expected future fare on the maturity date, $F_m$ is the actual observed fee on the date of maturity.

As stated in section \todo{ref}, the customer will calculate his willingness to pay for an option by multiplying his likelihood of travelling by the expected increase in price:

$$ V_c = (E[F_m] - F_0) \times P^f $$

The customer will only buy the option when his WTP is higher than the seller's option price:

$$ V_c \ge V_s $$


\todo{table}
Arrival: $ \sim \mbox{Poisson}(1)$
Number of days till maturity: 3


\subsection{Forecasting error with strong-from rational expectations}
Due to the linear influence of the error term on the forecast, the variance of the random error term will define the average forecasting error of the prediction. There are several ways to calculate this forecasting error. The \emph{Mean Absolute Percentage Error} ($\mbox{MAPE}$), for example, is defined as:

$$ \mbox{MAPE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum\limits_{k=0}^n \abs{\frac{F_m - E[F_m]}{F_m}} $$

When using the strong-form rational expectation, the MAPE is linearly related to the standard deviation of the error term distribution in the following way: $ \mbox{MAPE} = 0.798 \sigma $

\todo{ref table} shows the MAPE associated with several different levels of sigma. As the formula implied, this forecasting error is relatively associated to the standard deviation; higher values of $\sigma$ will result in a higher level of $\mbox{MAPE}$.

\subsection{Simulation results and analysis}
In this subsection I will present the results gained from running the simulation with the previously defined configuration of supply and demand submodels. I will also analyse these results and give explanations of the acquired data. To check the influence of certain parameters in the model, I will furthermore alter several variables to see their effect on the outcome of the simulation model.

\subsubsection{Results}
This first simulation run will look at the results obtained from a seller with perfect foresight who also knows the exact likelihood of flying of every customer. The customer in this simulation will base his predictions upon strong-form rational expectations.

\autoref{fig:normalized_profits} presents the normalized profits of all routes for selling airfare~lock-in products with different levels of margins. As can be seen in the graph, the seller with perfect knowledge does not make any profits when the margin is set to nil. This is of course an expected outcome, as the seller with foresight does make precise forecasts on the actual future price fluctuations, and does thereby not accidentally overestimate option prices which might result in profits. He does however set the option prices to the expected payout, which result in a total profits of zero.

\insertfigure{normalized_profits}{Normalized profits of all flights}

By increasing the margin, the all knowing seller is able to yield profits from the sold options. Because the writer sets his minimum acceptable option price to the expected payout, every percentage in margins will result in a percentage increase in profits when the option is sold. However, due to the customer only accepting an option when his willingness to pay exceeds the offered price, an increase in lock-in~fee will result in less passengers actually buying the ticket. This is also visible in the figure with normalized profits. The graph first shows an increasing trends in profits; the increase in margins outweighs the decrease in customers buying the option. After a certain level --- around 0.075 in given example --- the increasing trend changes in a loss of total profits for every higher margin.

The decreasing is also reflected in \autoref{fig:customer_decision_distribution}. The bars represent the percentage of customer's that chose to either \emph{buy} the flight immediately, \emph{wait} a few days till deciding to buy, or buy an option instead (i.e., \emph{option (buy)} and \emph{option (wait)} respectively). As can be reduced from the data, an increase in margin leads to a decrease in customer's willing to buy the option for the higher price.

\insertfigure{customer_decision_distribution}{Customer's decision distribution}

The relation between the profits gained by an increase in margin and the decrease in passengers buying options which both account for changes in total profits can be explained using the following equation:

$$ \mbox{total relative profits} = (1 - F(r)) * r $$

In which $r$ is the margin, and $F(r)$ is the cumulative distribution function of the customer's strong-form rational expectation function. This function can be defined as $\mathcal{N}(1, \sigma^2)$. The first part of the function ($1 - F(r)$) computes the expected percentage of customers that will still buy the option at a specified margin $r$. The multiplication by $r$ in the second part of the equation calculates the relative profits gained from selling all those options. Thus the higher the total relative profits, the higher the actual total profits are expected to be.

To check whether the previously formulated equation aligns with the results found in the simulation, I have calculated Pearson's correlation coefficient. \todo{ref} presents the outcomes of this test, and shows that the empirical and theoretical results are a extremely good fit. The equation can thus be used as substitute for the simulation.

\todo{table}
correlation coefficient: $0.9899$, p-value: $< 0.0001$

As shown in previous paragraphs, the total profits of a seller offering airfare~lock-in products are dependant on the margin that the seller adds to his option predictions. Next, as can be reduced from the equation, the accuracy of the customer's strong-form predictions are also relevant. An increase in error term in the customer's forecasts will results in a higher forecasting error (i.e., higher $\mbox{MAPE}$) as shown in \todo{ref}.

\autoref{fig:relative_profits_customer_accuracy} shows the influence of the customer's accuracy upon the realized total profits. The total profits are the relative change compared to the base model in which the passenger's strong-form error term is set at $0.01$, or a $\mbox{MAPE}$ of $0.0798$.

\insertfigure{relative_profits_customer_accuracy}{Relative increase in profits compared to customer's error term}

While relative option profits are equal amongst different routes due to the configuration of the simulation model, average absolute profits differ between flights. These mean profits per sold option are presented in \todo{ref}. The difference in absolute profits realized per accepted lock-in product can be explained by the average absolute price changes of that same flight. These figures are also given in the table, and show a near perfect correlation with the realized option profits.
