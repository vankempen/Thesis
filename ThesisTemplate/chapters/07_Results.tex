\section{The all knowing seller}
The first configuration will simulate an all knowing seller with the ability to forecast prices at maturity with a hundred~percent accuracy. In this scenario, the all knowing seller thus knows whether the customer is actually going to exercise the option at the date of maturity. Therefore, when the writer sees that the passenger will \emph{not} fly (which has a probability of $1-P^f$), he will accept any option price above \$\,0. On the other hand, when the airfare~lock-in product seller sees that the passenger \emph{will} exercise his option at the date of maturity, his Willingness To Accept equals his losses from selling the option (i.e., $p_{t+m} - p_t$), and he will thus only sell options to customers with a higher WTP.
