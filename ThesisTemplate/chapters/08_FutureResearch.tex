%Future research
%passenger arrival rate to de Boer and Wetherford

%is it really bad? => surplus

%more months of data -> seasonaity


\todo[The distribution of the arrival process for the simulation of passengers will be derived from the article by \citeA{weatherford1993modeling}. In their paper, the authors simulate the arrival according to a inhomogeneous Poisson process. \citeA{bertsimas2005simulation} defined a model more specific for the aviation industry based on the PARM-model.]{move to future research}
